# Synopsis
Data were collected from sensors that are fixed to specific positions on the bodies of 6 participants. Particpants were asked to perfrom specific activities namely "10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions". The data collected from the sensors will be used in this study to tell whether those activities were performed properly or not. More specifically, the study aims to build a machine learning model that can predict how excellent were the performance of these activities and classify it as A for an excellent performance or B,C,D,and E for different types of erratic performances.

#Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

##Data
The training data for this project are available here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
The test data are available here: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

##Study objective
The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 

##Author notes
For full reproducibility, the packages below should be installed first, and then the application will set the random number generator seed to 1235.

##The problem
Data were collected from sensors that are fixed to specific positions on the bodies of 6 participants. Particpants were asked to perfrom specific activities namely "10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions".

More specifically, the study aims to build a machine learning model that can predict how excellent were the performance of these activities and classify it as A for an excellent performance or B,C,D,and E for different types of erratic performances.

###Data Cleaning
```{r Data_Cleaning, cache=TRUE}
